## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autotrade.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd autotrade
    ```

3. Install Poetry if you havenâ€™t already:
    ```bash
    brew install poetry
    ```

4. Set up the project dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    This will install any dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. If no dependencies are listed, you can skip this step for now.

5. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

    Now you can run the project within the Poetry-managed virtual environment.


## Setting Up API Keys

This project requires an API key from `polygon.io` to function properly.

1. Copy the example `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Open the `.env` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual `polygon.io` API key:
    ```
    POLYGON_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3. The project will automatically load the API key from the `.env` file when you run it.
